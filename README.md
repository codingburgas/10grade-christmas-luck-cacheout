## 🛡 Functionality Overview

Lyrica offers a robust and modular approach to language learning. Here's an overview of its core functionalities:
- **Sign-Up System:** Lets new users register safely. It checks email and password to make sure they are valid.
- **Dashboard Management:** Shows flashcard sets (both pre-made and custom) and groups them so you can find them easily.
- **File Handling:** Saves and reads flashcard data in files so you don’t lose your work.
- **Card Creation Tool:** Allows you to make your own flashcards to fit your learning needs.
- **Page Navigation:** Makes it easy to switch between different parts of the app.

The app uses different parts of code (called classes) to handle each task. For example:

- **Files.h:** Saves and loads flashcard information.
- **SignupForm.h:** Handles user registration and checks the information you enter.
- **Dashboard.h:** Displays flashcards and makes them interactive.
